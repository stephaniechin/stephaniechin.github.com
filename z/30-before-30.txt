<h3>30 before 30</h3>
			Inspired by <href a="https://kethompson.wordpress.com/">The Truly Educated Never Graduate's</href> Kate Thompson (whom I've had the priveledge of studying under at PROMYS 2012!), I've made a master bucket list for the next 10 years spanning professional, artistic, and life goals: 
			<!--/ Professional /-->
