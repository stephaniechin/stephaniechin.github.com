It's messages validated my minimalist spending habits, which are personally motivated by my environmental concerns and my frugal lifestyle. This book discusses a lot of unpleasant realities that get swept under the rug, but it explains how positive achievements have led us this result. 

I appreciate the attention to detail and explicit citation of research throughout this book. By mentioning her sources -- including highly recognized research institutions -- Stein allows the audience to sense (or to research and to validate, if the reader so desires) the quality and bias-potential of the sources, as a check for the common pitfall of cherry-picking sources.

In retrospect, the book had always been equally as relevant to everyone in the US, due to the on-demand consumerism enabled by Amazon. 

*plus a few convenience stores, dollar stores, etc.
